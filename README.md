`upvuln` is a lightweight, professional Bash script designed to automate system updates, upgrades, and cleanup tasks on Linux-based systems. It ensures your system stays up-to-date, removes unnecessary packages, and fixes potential issues—all with a single command.

## 📋 Features

- **System Updates** : Automatically updates package lists (`apt update`).
- **Package Upgrades** : Upgrades all installed packages (`apt upgrade`).
- **Cleanup** : Removes unused packages and cleans cached files (`apt autoremove` and `apt autoclean`).
- **Dependency Fixes** : Configures pending packages and fixes broken dependencies.
- **Self-Installation** : Moves itself to `/usr/local/bin/` for global accessibility after execution.
- **Error Handling** : Includes robust error handling to ensure smooth operation.
